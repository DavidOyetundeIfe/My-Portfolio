<p>During my academic studies and personal exploration, I dedicated significant time to self-directed learning and practical application of front-end development principles. Through a series of personal projects,I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gained familiarity with frameworks such as React.js. These projects not only provided me with hands-on experience but also showcased my ability to independently solve problems and create functional web interfaces. While I haven't had formal work experience in front-end development, I actively sought opportunities to apply my skills in real-world contexts.Through volunteer work or community involvement, I contributed to initiatives that required web development expertise, such as designing and maintaining websites for local organizations or assisting with tech-related tasks for non-profit projects. These experiences allowed me to apply my technical skills in practical settings while making a positive impact within my community.</p>
